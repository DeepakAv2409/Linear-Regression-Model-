# Linear-Regression-Model-
 projects in Predictive Modelling involved gathering data on computer system activity from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712. Using this data, I performed a linear regression to determine how much of a system's time is spent in user mode (usr), and I discovered that every attribute has an impact on this time period.
